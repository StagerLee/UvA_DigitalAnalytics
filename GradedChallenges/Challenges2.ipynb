    "# Graded Challenges 2 (DA3 and DA4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you can work with your own datasets in Pandas, it's time for you to apply your newly gained knowledge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge consists of two components:\n",
    "1. **Programming and Interpretation**\n",
    "2. **Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some important notes for the challenges:**\n",
    "1. While we of course like when you get all the answers right, the important thing is to exercise and apply the knowledge. So we will give some credit for challenges that may not be complete, as long as we see enough effort. The rubric (see Canvas) reflects this.\n",
    "2. You will deliver the challenges on Canvas. Make sure to follow the turning-in instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Facing issues? \n",
    "\n",
    "We are constantly monitoring the issues on the GitHub to help you out. Don't hesitate to log an issue there, explaining well what the problem is, showing the code you are using, and the error message you may be receiving. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** We are only monitoring the repository in weekdays, from 9.30 to 17.00. Issues logged after this time will most likely be answered the next day. This means you should not wait for our response before submitting a challenge :-)\n"

    "In this challenge, you will work with your own Twitter data and will execute all the steps necessary for visualising answers to a simple research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming and interpretation challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use your actual Twitter data. To do so, you need to:\n",
    "* Use the Twitter data you have collected using twarc. \n",
    "* Request sentiment analysis for this dataset (see instructions on Canvas, and on the videos for DA2 & DA3)\n",
    "* The sentiment analysis results (get them from Onedrive)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use **the same data** that you requested sentiment analysis for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this challenge is to propose and visualize the answer to a RQ that takes sentiment as the dependent variable and some information about your tweets as independent variable. To be able to visualize the answer, you will need to take a number of steps described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Propose a research question that has **sentiment** as dependent variable and some **categorization of your tweets** as independent variable. **Make sure to write down the RQ in your submission**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The categorization needs to be meaningful for sentiment of tweets. It can be based on any available information in your data. You will need to create the categories in one of the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load your Twitter dataset and the dataset with sentiment scores of your tweets.\n",
    "2. Minimize and pseudonymize your Twitter dataset. *Tip: to minimize it, think what variable are necessary for you to answer your RQ.*\n",
    "3. Merge your tweets dataset with sentiment so that you have a sentiment score for each tweet. *Tip: Check if the length of the dataframe generated by the merge makes sense.*\n",
    "4. Create one variable that operationalizes the sentiment of tweets (i.e., that somehow aggregates the information of it being positive or negative - or potentially neutral - into one single variable).\n",
    "5. Write a function that categorizes your tweets. Apply this function to your data.\n",
    "    * The function can use Natural Language Processing (and categorize them based on the content of the tweets) or other rules (for example, categorize tweets based on engagement, authors etc.). \n",
    "    * The categorization can be binary (taking the value 0 (when the tweet is not of that category) or 1 (when the tweet is of that category) or categorical with multiple meaningful categories that a tweet can fall under, but needs to contain meaningful information about the tweets. \n",
    "6. Calculate the reliability of the sentiment analysis or of the category created on step 5. To do so, you will need to:\n",
    "    1. Export a random sample of (at least) 50 tweets to Excel\n",
    "    2. Manually code this random sample for sentiment and for the category created on step 5\n",
    "    3. Load the manually coded data on Pandas\n",
    "    4. Merge the manual coding you did with the automated categorization (steps 4 and 5)\n",
    "    5. Calculate intercoder reliability between your coding, and the automated categorization\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Visualise and provide descriptive statistics to answer your RQ: \n",
    "    1. Show descriptive statistics for the IV (categorical variable) and the DV (sentiment)\n",
    "    2. Create one univariate visualisation for the IV\n",
    "    3. Create one univariate visualisation for the DV\n",
    "    4. Create one bivariate visualisation with the IV and DV in the same chart\n",
    "    5. Show the descriptives of the DV grouped by the IV and interpret them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to combine code *and* markdown to answer these questions. Mention specifically the question (and question number) and the answer in markdown, relating to the code and the output of the code. Failing to do will impact the grade, as we will not be able to see whether you answered the question.\n",
    "2. For every line of code, please include a cell in MarkDown explaining what the code is expected to do.\n",

In this reflection, we ask you to focus on ethical and privacy considerations stemming from using such data for digital analytics. Please discuss the privacy risks as introduced by Tucker (2019) involved when such data from Twitter users are used for digital analytics (for example, answering your research questions), and what data-related considerations - related to and beyond privacy - need to be taken into account when collecting and analyzing tweets (following the Data Ethics Decision Aid).\n",
